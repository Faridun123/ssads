you to store multiple 
collections of data

# Destructuring and spread – Destructuring

# Destructuring and spread– spread
The spread operator ... is used to 
expand or spread an to make it 
works with own enumerable 
properties of an object. 
For example:

You can use the spread 
operator to clone the own 
enumerable properties of an 
object.

# This
The behavior of the this keyword in JavaScript is
somewhat different from its comparison with religious
languages. 
There are also differences in collection in strict and nonstrict mode.
this is not a variable. It is a keyword. 
You cannot change the value of this
In JavaScript, the this keyword refers to an object.
Which object depends on how this is being invoked (used or called).
The this keyword refers to different objects depending on how it is used

# bind()
With the bind() method, an object can borrow a method from another object.
This example creates 2 objects (person and member).
The member object borrows the fullname method from the person object:
